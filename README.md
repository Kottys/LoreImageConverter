# LoreImageConverter
Makes an image into a pasteable lore line to use on your lore.

1. Put the path of your image in: image = Image.open("your file path"), I would advise to have a image with a similar aspect ratio of 32x15
2. Run the program
3. Go to output.txt and copy the lore lines
    If you don't run the program in a folder it will output it to Users/yourname/output.txt.
    If you run it through command prompt and want the file in your folder:
        1. write cd "path to folder"
        2. write python converter.py, and now it should paste the output.txt file into your current folder
4. Paste the text in the lore editor (below the name), make sure it's a a hex lore
